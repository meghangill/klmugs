	<p>The one thing that AngularJS or Handlebars cannot offer is server-side templating - extremely important from the context of creating a blog as it means the search engines are other bot-like mechanisms that spawn the internet will have a hard time figuring out what's going on.</p>
	<p>This is why I eventually ended-up with Mustache, as it allowed me to use the same template tags within my HTML to be processed both by the server before the page is loaded, and via AJAX using JavaScript to re-process the DOM.</p>
